        <p>
            The **Smart Self-Training System** is an AI-powered platform designed to help users improve their skills in multiple sports, including Cricket, Tennis, and Badminton. 
            The system allows players to upload their action images (e.g., a bowling action in Cricket), and in return, it provides them with **video feedback and analysis**.
